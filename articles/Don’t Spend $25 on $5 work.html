Don’t Spend $25 on $5 Work: How to Make Your Labor More Efficient<hr /></h3>

<hr />
<p>Early on in my career as a district service manager visiting dealers, I made a scheduled visit to see a service manager. When I walked in to the dealership, the service manager told me that he did not have time to meet—he had to go run service calls. I have seen this misuse of time, in various forms, over and over in my career.</p>

<h4>Value Categories of Labor</h4>

<p>In each dealership, there are different levels of talent and responsibility, and I categorize them by assigning a numerical value to each one. The numbers are not necessarily what a person at that level earns. Instead, the number represent the relative value of his or her time.</p>

<p>$25 Labor</p>

<p>The highest value labor in each department or company is the most senior management. They need to focus their time and energy on tasks that only they can solve.</p>

<p>$20 Labor</p>

<p>The next highest value of labor is that of service supervisors. They need to focus their time on the teams they lead. They spend their time in the field solving customer and technician issues.</p>

<p>$15 Labor</p>

<p>These are your top technicians. They have the ability to solve most problems.</p>

<p>$10 Labor</p>

<p>This would represent the average trained technician. He or she is capable of handling most service calls. This level might also include technicians with minimal network skills.</p>

<p>$5 Labor</p>

<p>This category includes entry-level technicians, shop technicians, delivery drivers, and helpers.</p>

<h4>Value Categories of Work</h4>

<p>$25 Work</p>

<p>This category of work is primarily associated with managing the department. It includes planning for future growth, as well as overseeing training needs and budgets. This work would also include analyzing profitability and identifying where the department fails to meet the target.</p>

<p>This category also involves managing customer relations and coordinating with the sales department in identifying opportunities, as well as ensuring proper equipment usage.</p>

<p>$20 Work</p>


<p>This category includes providing hands-on training for technicians, as well as spending time inspecting the technician’s quality of work. It also includes addressing customer complaints and identifying the underlying causes of those complaints.</p>

<p>The supervisor is responsible for communicating guidance from the service manager to the team, and he or she also lets the team know about bulletins and updates from the manufacturer. The supervisor identifies the training his team needs and provides or arranges for that training.</p>

<p>$15 Work</p>

<p>This category includes the handling of more difficult service problems, ones which the average technician does not have the skills to resolve. In fact, the average technician probably made the initial call on the equipment. The technician’s ability was exhausted and the problem is still not resolved, so a more skilled or experienced colleague was called in.</p>

<p>This category probably includes service calls involving production print equipment, as well as specialty products such as wide format.</p>

<p>$10 Work</p>

<p>This is your everyday service call. The jobs are routine and the average technician has the needed skill-set to handle the issue.</p>

<p>$5 Work</p>

<p>This category includes all other basic tasks that do not fall into one of the other categories. It would include entry level tasks such as assisting with setups and deliveries, keeping the shop clean, and assisting more qualified individuals when needed.</p>

<h4>Proper Allocation of Resources</h4>

<p>Going back to the service manager I mentioned at the beginning of the article, on my next visit, he and I discussed this concept. I explained that as his company grew he would need to focus more and more of his time on the bigger issues, and that eventually he would spend his time driving a desk.</p>

<p>This is not to say that a service manager or supervisor should never perform a service call, but it would be an exceptional situation for them to do so on their own. If they need to visit equipment, it should normally include taking a technician with them. Why? It provides a learning opportunity for that technician. It also allows the supervisor or manager to observe the technician on-site and see what training may be necessary.</p>

<p>Managers and supervisors need to look at what they spend their time on and ask themselves “Who can I delegate this task to?” If there is no one with the needed skills, then it is their task to perform. If they see someone that they can delegate the task to, they should delegate it.</p>

<p>Think of this as the difference between firefighting and fire prevention. If the higher dollar talent is out doing the firefighting, the situation will never get better. They need to focus on fire prevention and delegate the firefighting to their team.</p>

<h4>Result</h4>

<p>When service departments and managers understand and apply this principle, the result is a team that is constantly evolving and improving. Service profitability will normally improve, and the workload will typically go down.</p>

<p>Technicians’ skill levels improve and they become better able to resolve their own problems. Customer satisfaction will improve because response time decreases and their equipment is repaired more effectively.</p>

<p>The last time I visited the service manager in this article, he was sitting at his desk analyzing the data on his department’s performance. The average monthly copy-volume-per-technician had more than doubled. The service department’s response time was excellent, and his cost-per-copy was significantly better than the national average.</p>
				
				
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>8:00 to 8:45: Supervisor takes technician on tour of facility, pointing out needed landmarks, such as restrooms, break rooms, smoking area and other important building features.</li>
<li>9:00 to 10:00: Manager briefs new technician on training plan. Manager provides copy of procedures manual and training plan. Manager enrolls technician on manufacturer website and enrolls technician in first class. Manager explains first day’s tasks and directs technician to appropriate work area.</li>
<li>10:00 to 11:00: Employee assigned to read first chapter of procedures manual.</li>
<li>11:00 to 12:00: Lunch</li>
<li>12:00 to 4:00: Employee continues reading, completes first form, and identifies the form’s purpose and where the form goes once it is completed.</li>
<li>4:00 to 5:00: Employee reviews activity with manager and they confirm the plan for the following day.</li>
<li>Utilize the same process and format for the remainder of the 100 days. Each day’s activity will be different, but let the plan explain what needs to be done and who is responsible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Use the Plan</h4>

<p>Now let’s go back and replay the scenario we started with. It is a new technician’s first day. The supervisor meets the technician at reception and provides a tour of the building. The technician comes into the service manager’s office. You give him or her the information discussed and a copy of the training plan. The manager reviews it and takes the technician to the day’s workspace.</p>

<p>So the process begins. There is never any question of what needs to happen. This process results in technicians with a consistent work product and requires minimal intervention during the first three months. And when it is time to make a decision on whether to retain or terminate the individual, you have objective standards to measure the technician’s success.</p>
